# gh-stats

**This is messy code and not very informative yet. See it as a
proof of concept of sorts.**

Fetch your personal Github statistics.

It asks you for your credentials and then fetches all information
about your repositories, commits and organizations.

## usage
```
gh-stats [-h/--help|-v/--verbose]
```
