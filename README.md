# gh-stats

**This is not very informative yet. See it as a
proof of concept of sorts.**

Fetch your personal Github statistics.

It asks you for your credentials and then fetches all information
about your repositories, commits and organizations. Mostly just
the number of commits, really.

## usage
```
gh-stats version 0.1.2
usage: gh-stats [(-v/--verbose)|(-h/--help)]
	where: -v/--verbose = print more info
	       -h/--help    = print help and exit
```
